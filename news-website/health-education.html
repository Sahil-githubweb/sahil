                <p>December 2, 2024: A sudden decree from Afghanistan's de facto Ministry of Public Health has shuttered all private and government-run health centers in four southern provinces, devastating healthcare access in an already vulnerable region.</p>
                <h2>Closure Impact</h2>
                <p>The directive affects Kandahar, Helmand, Nimroz, and Zabul provinces, leaving only Uruzgan with limited female health facilities. Over 600 female medical students were abruptly displaced during final exams, their academic futures in limbo.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <h2>Educational Consequences</h2>
                <p>At Zaranj's Afghan Zaranj Institute, instructors arrived to shuttered classrooms after learning of the ban through social media. "They didn't even notify us officially," lamented one teacher, still awaiting documentation three weeks later.</p>
                <h2>Systemic Collapse</h2>
                <p>The Taliban's healthcare restrictions compound existing challenges:</p>
                <ul class="crisis-list">
                    <li>Maternal mortality rates projected to rise 300%</li>
                    <li>87% drop in prenatal care availability</li>
                    <li>Only 12 female doctors remain practicing across 5 provinces</li>
